        <h2>What is a Contributor License Agreement?</h2>

        <p>A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute
            the code/documentation/translation to the project you&apos;re contributing to and are willing to have it
            used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the
            future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary
            forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.</p>

        <p>The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for
            its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not
            be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.</p>

        <h2>Signing the Go Pivotal, Inc. CLA</h2>

        <p>Signing a Go Pivotal, Inc. CLA enables you to contribute to projects managed by the company. You will be
            required to submit the following information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your company name (if you are signing on behalf of a company)</li>
            <li>Your mailing address</li>
            <li>Your country of residence</li>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>Your telephone number</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Signing a CLA (there are number of them based on the license of the project being contributed to) will enable
            you to contribute to any other Go Pivotal, Inc. project that uses the same license and CLA.</p>
